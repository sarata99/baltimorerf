                <h6>Who We Are</h6>
                <p>Baltimore Resource Finder is a website brought to you by two local UMBC graduates with a passion for serving the Baltimore community. We want to see a better city, with less inequities and hardship.
                </p>
                <h6>Our Why</h6>
                <p>It was through our volunteer experiences that we realized just how prevalent food, housing insecurities, and unaddressed medical needs are in many parts of Baltimore leading us to our next question: what services exist to address these needs and how can we volunteer with them to make a difference? We did a deep dive and found several NGO's, government agencies, and other non-profit organizations - a long and time-consuming endeavor. We want to make searching for service and volunteer opportunities easier through BaltimoreRF, so you can quickly scan various services and choose which ones may meet your needs and volunteer your time as well.</p>
                <h6>Our Goal</h6>
                <p>We aim to empower through access and service. We believe this is best accomplished through providing information - informed people make informed choices. </p>
